    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p>I am an international student currently living in Finland, with a strong academic background in non-medical sciences. My early education in subjects like mathematics, physics, and computer science has equipped me with a logical and analytical mindset, allowing me to approach problem-solving with precision and creativity. My passion for technology and user-centered design has driven me to explore digital service development, particularly in creating solutions that enhance accessibility and efficiency.</p>

<p>Mathematics has always been one of my favorite subjects, shaping my ability to think critically and solve complex problems systematically. This interest naturally led me to programming, where I enjoy applying logical reasoning to build intuitive and efficient digital solutions. I am currently focusing on JavaScript and exploring its applications in web development and digital services. Through this journey, I aim to develop services that are not only functional but also user-friendly and inclusive.</p>

<p> as an international student in Finland has given me a broader perspective on the role of technology in everyday life. Navigating a new country comes with challenges, from understanding public services to accessing digital platforms in a different language. These experiences have deepened my appreciation for well-designed digital services that prioritize usability and accessibility for diverse users. I am particularly interested in how technology can bridge gaps and improve user experiences for people from different backgrounds.</p>

<p> technical skills, I am passionate about user-oriented development. I believe that technology should be built with the end-user in mind, ensuring that digital services are not just efficient but also easy to use and accessible to all. This perspective guides my approach to problem-solvingâ€”combining data-driven decision-making with an emphasis on user needs.</p>

As I continue my journey in digital service development, I am eager to collaborate on projects that focus on enhancing user experiences through thoughtful design and innovative technology. My goal is to create digital solutions that make everyday interactions smoother, more intuitive, and inclusive for all users.</aside></p>
